# blog-vue-exercise

School project during my education @Lexicon

## Task:

To build a blog page with posts from the api JSON placeholder. The page is built with three different routes: one page where the user can add a post. One preview page with all the posts. One page that shows one selected post. 
The page has a search function to be able to search for a post. When the user clicks on a post it's collected from the database. The Add post function is only a simulation since it's not possible to add posts to the database. 

## Tech used: 
VUE, VUEX, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
